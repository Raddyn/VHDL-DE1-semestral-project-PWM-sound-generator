# VHDL-DE1-semestral-project-PWM-sound-generator
## TO-DO:

- Find sources, test function of PWM module -> DOMINIK
- Test audio jack out -> DOMINIK
- configure constraints file -> MAREK
- IMPORTANT! - Delegation of further tasks
- Rotary encoder -> ?
- Configuration of 7seg.vhd, mainly position of each display -> JARA
- Rough sketch of hardware, algorithm flowchart, top_level -> RADEK, MAREK
- Documentation -> MAREK, RADEK
- TO-DO management -> MAREK
- schematics -> RADEK

## File responsibility:
- top_level.vhd -> MAREK, RADEK
- mode_selector.vhd -> MAREK
- x7seg.vhd -> JARA
- top_x7seg.vhd -> JARA

## Description

- To be added
## Features
- Switch input determines if frequency or duty cycle is to be altered
- Frequency or (and?) duty cycle displayed on 7 segment disp.
- Current display position selected using buttons, flicker as indicator 
- Frequency or duty cycle selected using rotary encoder (or buttons?) 
- (optional QoL) LEDs indicate current frequency at all times
## Hardware

- Nexys A7 50
- Rotary encoder tbd...

  Initial VERY CRUDE sketch
